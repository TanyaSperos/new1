I'm a Creeper
Minecraft's Grim Reaper
Blowing up blocks like Al-Qaeda
I'm not a creature that'll eat ya
But I'll leave ya petrified, Peter!
Reminds peeps of Minesweeper
Clicking on a brick, then you die in the deep
I'll find your mine, I'm a mind reader
Now the mine is mine, it's finders keepers

Oh hi, I'm a creeper
So nice, nice to meet ya
Is that the time? It's time to leave
And tick
Tock
Tick
Tock

Boom boom boom!
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune
It's gonna make my brain go boom boom boom!
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune
